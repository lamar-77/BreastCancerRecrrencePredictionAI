Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), a publicly available and widely used repository for medical imaging research.
For this project, we use a Breast MRI dataset that contains real MRI scans of breast cancer patients.

1. Type of Data
 • Breast MRI images (2D slices or 3D volumes depending on the collection).
 • Images are provided in DICOM or NIfTI format.
 • Each scan belongs to a real patient but is fully anonymized.

2. Labels
 • Each MRI image is associated with a recurrence label:
 • 0 → No recurrence
 • 1 → Recurrence
 • Label information is taken from the dataset’s metadata file provided by TCIA.

3. Dataset Components
 • MRI images.
 • Metadata file containing:
 • Patient ID
 • Recurrence information (0/1)
 • Basic clinical notes if available (not used in our project)

4. Why We Use This Dataset
 • It is public, ethically safe, and does not require hospital approval.
 • It contains real MRI scans, making the model more realistic.
 • It is commonly used in research, which improves reliability and reproducibility.

5. How It Is Used in Our Project

We use this dataset to:
 • Preprocess MRI images (resize, cleaning, normalization)
 • Build the training, validation, and testing splits
 • Train the CNN to detect recurrence patterns
 • Evaluate model accuracy

6. Ethical & Privacy Considerations
 • All images are anonymized by TCIA.
 • No personal patient identifiers are included.
 • The project uses only open-source data—no private hospital records.
